**Features and stuff to add to our web app (Current and fututre):

- Make a time of the day feature, along with duration of events. -> this is available as an option for if the person chooses to
    use times or just adds the events to the list without times.
- make a save button on the app in order to save the list that was created in a txt file, in order to have it then be further converted to an excel format,
etc (Whatver we choose to go with for the format or way to store the information so that it can be accessed in a convenient way ans used as a template for increased reusibility)
- otpion to modify previously saved lists and templates in order to make them more convenient and reusable.
- add some more colour and expression to our web page in order to make it look more appealing to the user.
- How will we incorporate the theory weâ€™ve learned? -> down the line this will be compared with our project and the slides for the class
- make the lists available in different visual formats on the website, based on different preferences chosen by the user (In the column format, or in the regular non column format)
